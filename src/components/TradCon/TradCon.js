          <h3 className="header1">1. General provisions</h3>

          <p className="listtag">1.0.</p> None of these conditions apply in actuality as this is a part of a university project.<br></br><br></br>

          <p className="listtag">1.1.</p> These General Trading Terms and Conditions form an essential and
          necessary part of every offer and
          every agreement concluded with the Contractor. By acceptance of these
          terms and conditions, within
          the meanning of section 263 of the Commercial Code, Section III, both
          parties exclude statutory
          regulations of the Commercial Code, Section III, which are
          inconsistent with them.<br></br><br></br>
          
          
          <p className="listtag">1.2.</p> The Contract is not bound by any trading terms and conditions
          mentioned in the Buyer's written
          documents. Signing an order and its sending back is deemed to be the
          order confirmation only, not
          the acceptance of the Buyer's trading terms and conditions.<br></br><br></br>
          
          <h3 className="header">2. Modification of terms and conditions</h3>
          <p className="listtag">2.1.</p> These General Trading Terms and Conditions may only be modified
          by written amendments, signed
          by a person authorized by the Contractor.
          <br></br><br></br>
          <h3 className="header">3. Prices</h3>
          <p className="listtag">3.1.</p> For deliveries of goods from the Contractor's warehouse in the
          Czech Republic, prices of goods shall
          be quoted in Czech Crowns or in Euros, depending on the specific
          contract.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">3.2.</p> Delivery shall be billed by the Contractor as of the day that
          goods are delivered.
          <br></br><br></br>
          <h3 className="header">4. Terms of payment</h3>
          <p className="listtag">4.1.</p> All payments shall be payable within 14 days of the day that the
          respective invoice is issued, unless
          otherwise agreed. The day of payment is regarded to be the day the sum
          is credited to the
          Contractor's account and is free for disposal, unless otherwise
          agreed.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">4.2.</p> Unless otherwise agreed, all payments in currency of CZK shall be
          remitted into the Contractor's
          bank account No.17626413/0300, at Československá obchodní banka,a.s.,
          and all payments in
          currency of EUR shall be remitted into the Contractor's bank account
          No.06429280/0300, at
          Československá obchodní banka,a.s. Payments of any Contractor's claims
          to individual Contractor's
          employees with the legal effect of debt repayment shall only be
          acceptable for cash payments and if
          the Contractor's employee proves the authorization to collect, issued
          by the Contractor.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">4.3.</p> Should the payment term not be kept, the Buyer shall be in
          default and any other existing claims
          against the Buyer as of that day shall become payable with immediate
          effect. The Contractor's claims
          against the Buyer shall also become payable with immediate effect if a
          motion for the institution of
          insolvency proceedings with respect to Buyer's assets is filed, or if
          such proceedings are commenced,
          or if the Buyer actually suspends payments. In such cases, the
          Contractor shall also be entitled to
          cancel current deliveries, or to request immediate payment of the
          purchase price in cash, or to request
          an advance payment. The Contractor's right to compensation for damages
          on account of failure to
          fulfil shall be retained by the Contractor.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">4.4.</p> If the Buyer does not pay the purchase price within the term of
          payment, the parties agree a
          contractual penalty, amounting to 0.05% of the due amount per every
          started day of the Buyer's
          delay in payment, but not less than CZK 7,000. By payment of the
          contractual penalty, the2 Contractor's right to compensation
          for damages shall not be affected; the Contractor shall be entitled
          to claim for damages even in an amount exceeding the paid contractual
          penalty. Costs of legal
          assistance related to debt recovery shall be regarded as ancillary
          rights of the debt and shall be billed
          to the Buyer separately. In individual cases the Contractor may waive
          its claim for payment of the
          contractual penalty.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">4.5.</p> The Buyer shall not be entitled to refuse or to defer any payment
          on account of a complaint about
          defects. In the case of a complaint about visual defects, the payment
          shall be solved by mutual
          agreement of both parties.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">4.6.</p> The Contractor shall be entitled to suspend delivery of ordered
          products till the Buyer fulfils all its
          obligations against the Contractor existing as of the agreed date of
          delivery.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">4.7.</p> The prices of goods as quoted by the Contractor are based, among
          other things, on the prices of raw
          materials, employees' wages, prices of energy, costs required for
          replacement of missing raw
          materials by other raw materials and exchange rate fluctuations. The
          Contractor predominantly
          reserves the right to change prices of goods accordingly if the prices
          or values of the items as stated
          above change. However, such a change shall not affect any delivery of
          goods executed on the basis
          of an order confirmed by the Contractor before the prices of goods
          were changed.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">4.8.</p> The Buyer undertakes to indicate the Contractor's bank account
          number, constant symbol, variable
          symbol, remitted amount and due date in every payment order given to
          its bank.<br></br><br></br>

          <p className="listtag">5.1.</p> Unless otherwise agreed, the Seller shall choose the carrier and
          shall pay costs connected with the
          transport of goods to the place of destination; goods shall always be
          delivered and shipped at the risk
          of the Buyer (CPT, Incoterms 2000). The method of shipment shall be

          with the Buyer.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">5.2.</p> The transport shall only be insured if it is ordered by the Buyer
          in writing, at the Buyer's expense.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">5.3.</p> If an order for goods was not cancelled properly and the goods
          cannot be delivered to the Buyer for 
          reason on the part of the Buyer, and the Contractor cannot use the
          goods for further sale of
          processing, the goods shall be stored at the risk of the Buyer. The
          costs for storage of such goods
          shall be 4% of the purchase price of the goods per every started
          month, commencing on the first day
          of such storage. Should the Buyer not take goods over within one month
          of the agreed takeover date,
          the Contractor shall be entitled to terminate the contract, and the
          Buyer shall pay the Contractor the
          costs for storage or alternative location of the goods (if paid by the
          Contractor) and a contractual
          penalty, amounting to 20% of the price of the stored goods. By
          agreement or payment of the
          contractual penalty, the Contractor's right to compensation for
          damages shall not be affected.<br></br><br></br>

          pallets shall be used, unless otherwise
          agreed. Unless otherwise agreed, the cost of pallets shall be included

          <p className="listtag">6.1.</p> Goods may be collected from the warehouse within 7 – 10 working
          days, or within 14 working days
          of written or phone order confirmation if delivered goods are
          cardboard tubes determined for further
          processing. If the Buyer, however, confirmed the other delivery
          condition of EXW, he must always
          ask in advance whether the required goods are in stock.
          <br></br><br></br>
          <h3 className="header">7. Joint provisions</h3>
          <p className="listtag">7.1.</p> The Contractor shall not be responsible for a breach of any of
          its obligations under the contractual
          relationship arisen in consequence of unforeseeable obstacles, among
          others in manufacture, during
          transport, in the case of supply problems at the company of the
          Contractor or its suppliers, or due to
          force majeure. For the purposes of contractual relations between the
          Contractor and the Buyer, force
          majeure is primarily deemed to be the breakdown of the Contractor's
          machines, shortage of driving
          force or energy, strike, shutdown, fire, flood and any circumstance
          beyond the control of the
          Contractor due to which the Contractor cannot fulfil its obligations.
          If the Contractor cannot fulfil its 3
          
          obligations due to force majeure temporarily, its obligations under
          the contract shall be suspended till
          the effects of force majeure terminate. If the Contractor cannot
          fulfil its obligations due to force
          majeure in full for unlimited period of time, or for more than one
          month, the Contractor shall be
          entitled to terminate this Contract. Should the facts as provided in
          Art. 7.1 of the General Trading
          Terms and Conditions above occur, the Buyer shall not be entitled to
          compensation for damages. The
          Contractor undertakes to notify the Buyer of force majeure and its
          consequences without undue
          delay.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">7.2.</p> The Contractor shall not compensate the Buyer for damages if
          delivery terms are exceeded.
          <br></br><br></br>
          <h3 className="header">8. Defects of goods</h3>
          <p className="listtag">8.1.</p> The Buyer shall check delivered goods carefully as soon as
          possible, and any complaints referring to
          delivered goods must be filed with the Contractor by e-mail or by
          registered mail within 3 days of
          the takeover of goods according to the delivery note. If a complaint
          is sent by e-mail, consequently a
          written notice must be sent by registered mail within seven days of
          the goods takeover according to
          the delivery note. A complaint should be attached with photo
          documentation of the established
          defects of goods. After expiry of the said period, the goods shall be
          considered to be free of defects,
          with the exception of possible hidden defects. Damages caused by
          transport must be notified
          immediately in a suitable manner and documented in a record, made in
          the presence of the carrier
          upon the takeover of goods from the carrier.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">8.2.</p> Complaints about hidden defects of goods must be filed with the
          Contractor by the e-mails and then
          also by the registered mail immediately after their establishment.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">8.3.</p> All guarantees and rights to compensation for damage shall be
          excluded if goods were stolen or used,
          as well as if goods were changed without the knowledge and approval of
          the Contractor. The
          Contractor's liability for defects shall be excluded if storage
          conditions as recommended by the
          Contractor were not kept.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">8.4.</p> The justification of a complaint filed in due time shall be
          established by the Contractor's Inspection
          Department. The Buyer must submit the goods under complaint to the
          Seller. If the Contractor does
          not accept a complaint and in spite of that the Buyer insists on the
          complaint, the Contractor shall
          submit the goods under complaint to an authorized test laboratory for
          assessment. The result of the
          assessment by the authorized test laboratory shall be final, and the
          costs incurred in connection with
          the examination shall be paid by the losing party against which the
          assessment result was issued.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">8.5.</p> If a complaint is admitted as justified, the Contractor, after
          agreement with the Buyer, must either
          provide replacement or credit the corresponding amount for the benefit
          of the Buyer.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">8.6.</p> Any returned goods shall only be accepted after previous written
          agreement and in the original
          packing. Should any doubt about the price arise, the price agreed for
          delivery of the goods to the
          Buyer shall apply.
          <br></br><br></br>
          <h3 className="header">9. Reservation of title</h3>
          <p className="listtag">9.1.</p> The title to all goods delivered by the Contractor shall be
          retained by the Contractor till the full
          payment of the purchase price, including all fees, has been made. If
          the Contractor has several
          overdue claims against the Buyer, the title to goods shall pass to the
          Buyer only after the payment of
          all the claims, including their ancillary rights.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">9.2.</p> The Buyer must use any delivered goods that are still owned by
          the Contractor carefully and must
          store them accordingly. The Buyer undertakes to follow all of the
          Contractor's instructions as given
          to the Buyer by the Contractor in order to protect the goods or its
          title.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">9.3.</p> Any pledge or other encumbrance of products owned by the
          Contractor is not acceptable. The
          Contractor must be notified of any act of a third person against the
          Contractor's goods by reason of
          intervention.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">9.4.</p> By agreement of the reservation of the title, the time that the
          liability for damage to goods passes to
          the Buyer under law or under these General Trading Terms and
          Conditions shall not be affected.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">9.5.</p> The Contractor shall be entitled to request immediate return of
          any goods delivered if the Buyer did
          not pay the price of goods duly and on time, or if the Buyer actually
          suspended its payments.4
          <br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">9.6.</p> Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, if the Contractor
          takes any goods back, it does not
          mean that the Contractor terminates the contract. If sold goods, still
          owned by the Contractor, are
          taken back, the Contractor shall retain the right to claim for damages
          on account of failure to fulfil a
          contractual obligation.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">9.7.</p> Till the reservation of the title expires, the Buyer shall be
          considered as the steward of the goods sold
          with the reservation of the title.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">9.8.</p> The costs incurred on account of the enforcement of the
          Contractor's title shall be regarded
          as the Buyer's costs.
          <br></br><br></br>
          <h3 className="header">10. Concluding provisions</h3>
          <p className="listtag">10.1.</p> These trading terms and conditions were executed in Czech.
          Slovak, English and German. Should
          any differences arise among individual versions, the Czech language
          version shall prevail.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">10.2.</p> The relations between the parties shall be governed by the Czech
          legal order. Any legal relations not
          regulated in the contract or these terms and conditions expressly
          shall be governed by Act 513/1991
          Coll., Commercial Code. In cases of contracts with an international
          element, the United Nations
          Convention on Contracts for the International Purchase of Goods

          which is part of the Czech legal order; the Convention according to
          the clause in front of the
          semicolon shall be applied even if the Buyer does not have a
          registered office in the country which isa party to the
          Convention.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">10.3.</p> If any of the provisions of these trading terms and conditions
          is or becomes ineffective, other
          provisions of these terms and conditions shall remain in effect. The
          parties undertake to supersede
          the ineffective provision of these terms and conditions by another
          effective provision which shall
          correspond best to the content and sense of the original ineffective
          provision. Any invalidity of
          individual provisions of the General Trading Terms and Conditions
          shall not affect the validity of
          other provisions.<br></br><br></br>
          <p className="listtag">10.4.</p> If the content of a concluded individual contract is
          inconsistent with the provisions of these General
          Trading Terms and Conditions, the individual contract shall prevail.<br></br><br></br>
