          mentioned in the Buyer's written<br></br>
          documents. Signing an order and its sending back is deemed to be the

          respective invoice is issued, unless<br></br>
          otherwise agreed. The day of payment is regarded to be the day the sum
          is credited to the<br></br>
          Contractor's account and is free for disposal, unless otherwise
          agreed.<br></br>

          default and any other existing claims<br></br>
          against the Buyer as of that day shall become payable with immediate
          effect. The Contractor's claims<br></br>

          for damages shall not be affected; the Contractor shall be entitled
          <br></br>
          to claim for damages even in an amount exceeding the paid contractual
          penalty. Costs of legal<br></br>
          assistance related to debt recovery shall be regarded as ancillary
          rights of the debt and shall be billed<br></br>
          to the Buyer separately. In individual cases the Contractor may waive
          its claim for payment of the<br></br>

          delivery.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">4.7.</text> The prices of goods as quoted by the Contractor are based, among

          materials, employees' wages, prices of energy, costs required for
          replacement of missing raw<br></br>
          materials by other raw materials and exchange rate fluctuations. The
          Contractor predominantly<br></br>
          reserves the right to change prices of goods accordingly if the prices
          or values of the items as stated<br></br>
          above change. However, such a change shall not affect any delivery of
          goods executed on the basis<br></br>

          were changed.<br></br>

          transport of goods to the place of destination; goods shall always be
          delivered and shipped at the risk<br></br>
          of the Buyer (CPT, Incoterms 2000). The method of shipment shall be
          determined after agreement<br></br>
          with the Buyer.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">5.2.</text> The transport shall only be insured if it is ordered by the Buyer
          in writing, at the Buyer's expense.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">5.3.</text> If an order for goods was not cancelled properly and the goods
          cannot be delivered to the Buyer for a<br></br>
          reason on the part of the Buyer, and the Contractor cannot use the
          goods for further sale of<br></br>
          processing, the goods shall be stored at the risk of the Buyer. The
          costs for storage of such goods<br></br>
          shall be 4% of the purchase price of the goods per every started
          month, commencing on the first day<br></br>
          of such storage. Should the Buyer not take goods over within one month
          of the agreed takeover date,<br></br>
          the Contractor shall be entitled to terminate the contract, and the
          Buyer shall pay the Contractor the<br></br>

          Contractor) and a contractual<br></br>
          penalty, amounting to 20% of the price of the stored goods. By
          agreement or payment of the<br></br>
          contractual penalty, the Contractor's right to compensation for
          damages shall not be affected.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">5.4.</text> If goods are delivered on pallets, disposable pallets or euro
          pallets shall be used, unless otherwise<br></br>
          agreed. Unless otherwise agreed, the cost of pallets shall be included
          in the price of delivered goods,<br></br>
          and the pallets shall not be returnable.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h3 className="header">6.Delivery terms</h3>
          <text className="listtag">6.1.</text> Goods may be collected from the warehouse within 7 – 10 working
          days, or within 14 working days<br></br>
          of written or phone order confirmation if delivered goods are
          cardboard tubes determined for further<br></br>
          processing. If the Buyer, however, confirmed the other delivery
          condition of EXW, he must always<br></br>
          ask in advance whether the required goods are in stock.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h3 className="header">7. Joint provisions</h3>
          <text className="listtag">7.1.</text> The Contractor shall not be responsible for a breach of any of
          its obligations under the contractual<br></br>
          relationship arisen in consequence of unforeseeable obstacles, among
          others in manufacture, during<br></br>
          transport, in the case of supply problems at the company of the
          Contractor or its suppliers, or due to<br></br>
          force majeure. For the purposes of contractual relations between the
          Contractor and the Buyer, force<br></br>
          majeure is primarily deemed to be the breakdown of the Contractor's
          machines, shortage of driving<br></br>
          force or energy, strike, shutdown, fire, flood and any circumstance
          beyond the control of the<br></br>
          Contractor due to which the Contractor cannot fulfil its obligations.
          If the Contractor cannot fulfil its 3<br></br>
          <br></br>
          obligations due to force majeure temporarily, its obligations under
          the contract shall be suspended till<br></br>
          the effects of force majeure terminate. If the Contractor cannot
          fulfil its obligations due to force<br></br>
          majeure in full for unlimited period of time, or for more than one
          month, the Contractor shall be<br></br>
          entitled to terminate this Contract. Should the facts as provided in
          Art. 7.1 of the General Trading<br></br>
          Terms and Conditions above occur, the Buyer shall not be entitled to
          compensation for damages. The<br></br>
          Contractor undertakes to notify the Buyer of force majeure and its
          consequences without undue<br></br>
          delay.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">7.2.</text> The Contractor shall not compensate the Buyer for damages if
          delivery terms are exceeded.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h3 className="header">8. Defects of goods</h3>
          <text className="listtag">8.1.</text> The Buyer shall check delivered goods carefully as soon as
          possible, and any complaints referring to<br></br>
          delivered goods must be filed with the Contractor by e-mail or by
          registered mail within 3 days of<br></br>
          the takeover of goods according to the delivery note. If a complaint
          is sent by e-mail, consequently a<br></br>
          written notice must be sent by registered mail within seven days of
          the goods takeover according to<br></br>
          the delivery note. A complaint should be attached with photo
          documentation of the established<br></br>
          defects of goods. After expiry of the said period, the goods shall be
          considered to be free of defects,<br></br>
          with the exception of possible hidden defects. Damages caused by
          transport must be notified<br></br>
          immediately in a suitable manner and documented in a record, made in
          the presence of the carrier<br></br>
          upon the takeover of goods from the carrier.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">8.2.</text> Complaints about hidden defects of goods must be filed with the
          Contractor by the e-mails and then<br></br>
          also by the registered mail immediately after their establishment.
          <br></br>
          <text className="listtag">8.3.</text> All guarantees and rights to compensation for damage shall be
          excluded if goods were stolen or used,<br></br>
          as well as if goods were changed without the knowledge and approval of
          the Contractor. The<br></br>
          Contractor's liability for defects shall be excluded if storage
          conditions as recommended by the<br></br>
          Contractor were not kept.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">8.4.</text> The justification of a complaint filed in due time shall be
          established by the Contractor's Inspection<br></br>
          Department. The Buyer must submit the goods under complaint to the
          Seller. If the Contractor does<br></br>
          not accept a complaint and in spite of that the Buyer insists on the
          complaint, the Contractor shall<br></br>
          submit the goods under complaint to an authorized test laboratory for
          assessment. The result of the<br></br>
          assessment by the authorized test laboratory shall be final, and the
          costs incurred in connection with<br></br>
          the examination shall be paid by the losing party against which the
          assessment result was issued.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">8.5.</text> If a complaint is admitted as justified, the Contractor, after
          agreement with the Buyer, must either<br></br>
          provide replacement or credit the corresponding amount for the benefit
          of the Buyer.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">8.6.</text> Any returned goods shall only be accepted after previous written
          agreement and in the original<br></br>
          packing. Should any doubt about the price arise, the price agreed for
          delivery of the goods to the<br></br>
          Buyer shall apply.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h3 className="header">9. Reservation of title</h3>
          <text className="listtag">9.1.</text> The title to all goods delivered by the Contractor shall be
          retained by the Contractor till the full<br></br>
          payment of the purchase price, including all fees, has been made. If
          the Contractor has several<br></br>
          overdue claims against the Buyer, the title to goods shall pass to the
          Buyer only after the payment of<br></br>
          all the claims, including their ancillary rights.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">9.2.</text> The Buyer must use any delivered goods that are still owned by
          the Contractor carefully and must<br></br>
          store them accordingly. The Buyer undertakes to follow all of the
          Contractor's instructions as given<br></br>
          to the Buyer by the Contractor in order to protect the goods or its
          title.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">9.3.</text> Any pledge or other encumbrance of products owned by the
          Contractor is not acceptable. The<br></br>
          Contractor must be notified of any act of a third person against the
          Contractor's goods by reason of<br></br>
          intervention.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">9.4.</text> By agreement of the reservation of the title, the time that the
          liability for damage to goods passes to<br></br>
          the Buyer under law or under these General Trading Terms and
          Conditions shall not be affected.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">9.5.</text> The Contractor shall be entitled to request immediate return of
          any goods delivered if the Buyer did<br></br>
          not pay the price of goods duly and on time, or if the Buyer actually
          suspended its payments.<br></br>4<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <text className="listtag">9.6.</text> Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, if the Contractor
          takes any goods back, it does not<br></br>
          mean that the Contractor terminates the contract. If sold goods, still
          owned by the Contractor, are<br></br>
          taken back, the Contractor shall retain the right to claim for damages
          on account of failure to fulfil a<br></br>
          contractual obligation.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">9.7.</text> Till the reservation of the title expires, the Buyer shall be
          considered as the steward of the goods sold<br></br>
          with the reservation of the title.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">9.8.</text> The costs incurred on account of the enforcement of the
          Contractor's title shall be regarded<br></br>
          as the Buyer's costs.<br></br>

          <text className="listtag">10.1.</text> These trading terms and conditions were executed in Czech.
          Slovak, English and German. Should<br></br>
          any differences arise among individual versions, the Czech language
          version shall prevail.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">10.2.</text> The relations between the parties shall be governed by the Czech
          legal order. Any legal relations not<br></br>

          shall be governed by Act 513/1991<br></br>
          Coll., Commercial Code. In cases of contracts with an international
          element, the United Nations<br></br>
          Convention on Contracts for the International Purchase of Goods
          (Vienna, 1980) shall be applied,<br></br>
          which is part of the Czech legal order; the Convention according to
          the clause in front of the<br></br>
          semicolon shall be applied even if the Buyer does not have a

          parties undertake to supersede<br></br>
          the ineffective provision of these terms and conditions by another
          effective provision which shall<br></br>
          correspond best to the content and sense of the original ineffective
          provision. Any invalidity of<br></br>
          individual provisions of the General Trading Terms and Conditions
          shall not affect the validity of<br></br>
          other provisions.<br></br>
          <text className="listtag">10.4.</text> If the content of a concluded individual contract is
          inconsistent with the provisions of these General<br></br>
          Trading Terms and Conditions, the individual contract shall prevail.
          <br></br>
          <text className="listtag">10.5.</text> All disputes in relation to the contract concluded between the
          parties or these General Trading Terms<br></br>

          Economic Chamber of the Czech Republic and Agrarian Chamber of the
          Czech Republic according<br></br>
